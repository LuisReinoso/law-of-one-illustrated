An autonomous story agent that turns any idea into illustrated stories. Real multi-image consistency.

## What It Actually Does

- Feed it any topic → get a complete illustrated story
- The agent figures out characters, scenes, and style on its own  
- Every character looks the same across all pages (using Nano-Banana's multi-ref magic)
- Watch the agent think, plan, and call tools in real-time
- Outputs ready-to-read PDF + all the source files
- **Beautiful web interface** for creating and viewing stories

## How It Works

Topic → Claude SDK agent reads custom prompt → orchestrates MCP tools → Nano-Banana generates images → local files + PDF

The agent handles everything. You watch it work (or just wait for your story).

## Two Ways to Use

### 🖥️ Beautiful Web Interface (Recommended for Demos)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the gorgeous frontend
cd frontend
python app_simple.py
# Opens browser at http://localhost:8080

# Click "Create My Storybook", enter your idea, and watch the magic happen!
# Stories appear in the gallery with page-flip animation
```

### ⚡ Pure Terminal (Fastest)
```bash
# Just run directly
python create_story.py "detective cat solves art heist"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Get uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone <repo>
cd cc-sdk-storybook
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your FAL key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env - add FAL_KEY from https://fal.ai

# Copy MCP config (no editing needed)
cp .mcp.json.template .mcp.json

# Make a story
python create_story.py "detective cat solves art heist"
```

## Try These

**Simple:**
```bash
python create_story.py "robot discovers emotions"
```

**Multiple characters with style:**
```bash
python create_story.py "fox and owl solve mysteries in watercolor style"
python create_story.py "three pirates find treasure, digital art, vibrant colors"
```

**Specify length:**
```bash
python create_story.py "space adventure, 10 pages"
python create_story.py "dragon learns to fly, 5 page short story"
```

**Go wild:**
```bash
python create_story.py "philosophical zombies debate existence in a coffee shop, noir style, 7 pages"
```

**See everything:**
```bash
python create_story.py --debug "your story"  # Watch the agent think and work
python create_story.py --verbose "your story"  # See tool calls as they happen
```
